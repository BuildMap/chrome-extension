For example, asking questions like 'What do you find most frustrating about current solutions in the market?'\n- Analyze Results: Systematically analyze the interview results to extract common themes or needs. For instance, if a majority mention the speed of service, that's a key area to focus on.\n- Iterate: Based on your findings, iterate on your product or service offering to better perform the 'job' customers hire it for.

For example, ask how disappointed customers would be without a certain feature.\n- Analyze Results: Use the survey data to identify which features are most impactful on customer satisfaction. For instance, if 80% of respondents rate a feature as a 'must-have', it's a high-priority item.\n- Prioritize Features: Finally, prioritize feature development based on their classification and customer feedback. For example, focus initially on 'Basic Needs' before moving onto 'Delighters'."
